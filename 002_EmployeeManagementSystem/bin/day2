1.display all numbers between num1 to num2 / any 2 numbers
2.count number of digits
3.reverse of a number
4.check whether given number is amstrong or not
5.method to get any two numbers and findout all armstrong numbers between them
ans)
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int low = 999, high = 99999;

    for(int number = low + 1; number < high; ++number) {
      int digits = 0;
      int result = 0;
      int originalNumber = number;

      // number of digits calculation
      while (originalNumber != 0) {
        originalNumber /= 10;
        ++digits;
      }

      originalNumber = number;

      // result contains sum of nth power of its digits
      while (originalNumber != 0) {
        int remainder = originalNumber % 10;
        result += Math.pow(remainder, digits);
        originalNumber /= 10;
      }

      if (result == number) {
        System.out.print(number + " ");
      }
    }
  }
}

method overloading
if a class has more than one method having same name
