Java Naming convention:
1.package name should be in lower case
(project1)
2.all classes or interfaces first letter should be capital
(Project,Greetings)
3. if class or interface containing more than one word , first letter of each word should be in upper case
(NumberCalculator, FileNotFoundException)
4. variable or method name first character should be in lower case but if more than one word containing then from second word,
first letter should be capital
(name,firstName,secondName),
method example - find(), nextInt(), findFirstNumber()
5. constant variable name should be in upper case
eg- double PI=3.14;



Comments are not executable:

Single line comment: for writting single line comment
//java code to print hello and welcome to java world
 
 Multiline comment: for more than one line comment
/* 
line 1
line 2
line 3
*/

To print something in console - for constant message or variables
System.out.println("hello");

shortcut to run application
ctrl + f11


All public class name should match with file name

Run->run configurations->Arguments tab-> there we can give name to display using args


Java library divided in to number of packages:
by default we will getting - lang package
io - inputs and outputs
net - related to networking
util -it is a simple text scanner which can 
parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions

simple statement- when u runs sees all information one by one without skipping anything or 
All lines executes one by one without skipping anything

Q1. Write a Java class that declares variables to represent the length and width of a room in feet. Assign appropriate values to 
the variables-for example, length = 15 and width = 25. Compute and display the floor space of the room in square feet 
(area = length * width). Display explanatory text with the value—for example, The floor space is 375 square feet. Save the class 
as Room.java.

main method why do we use ?
public static void main(String args[])
Why we write public static and void before main method?
Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static 
allows main to be called without creating an object of the class in which 
the main method is defined.



IPO cycle - need to follow every time
	I=>input(take value from user)
				P=>processing based on input or operator given
				O=>output
				
variable- it is memory location

Data types-
 byte -1byte
  char -2
  int -4
  long -8 
  float 
  double
  boolean

conditional statement-
1st- if else
Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
T/F				
	need to check if given statement is true what need to 
                   else if given statemtn is false what need to 
                   
                   if(expression)
                   statement for true
                   else
                   statemtnt for false
                   
                   
                   if(expression){
                   set of statements for true
                   }
                   else{
                   set of statements for false
                   }
                             			
				we can also use if else if more that one condition
		
		package name: conditional
		Q1: java code to get age of two trainees and find out who is elder
		Q2: java code to get any 3 numbers and find difference between biggest and smallest number
		Q3: java code to get cost price and sale price of an item and findout loss or profit / no loss no profit
		Q4: java code to get unit of electricity consumed and find the electric bill based on following
		     - if units are less than 200 it is free
		     - if units are >200 and <=500, then have to pay 5.25 rupees per unit
		     - example- if 280 units 200 units are free and remaining 80 will be charges
		     - units are >500 and <=800, 8.50 per unit	
		Q5: java code to get marks for c,c++,java, find out grade based on avg marks
		   A++ >90
		   A   >80
		   B   >70
		   C   >60
		   D   <60
		 
		 2nd conditional statement
		 switch case
		 
		 Syntax:
		 switch(choice){
		 case 1:
		 statement for true;
		 break;
		 case 2:
		 statement for true;
		 break;
		 case 3:
		 statement for true;
		 break;
		 case N;
		 statement for true;
		 break;
		 default:
		 statement for false;

	Q. java code to create a menu driven program which will ask choice based on choice 
	do some calculation
	
	calculator
1.Add
2.Sub
3.Mul
4.Div
5.exit

Enter you choice(1-5):
1
enter first number:12

What is method in java?
It is a block of code , used for completing a specific task

Method Access mode
Method name
Method parameters
mathod return type



private
protected
public
default

calling method and called method

method example

public static int div(int num1,int num2) {
		
		return(num1/num2);

		}
		
class and object:
a factory to produce same kind of objects

class Name:Car
=======================
property:
brand,model,color,capacity
============================
methods
Rocking on road,
standing 
out of order


System.err.println() if we find any error

Loop- set of statements
we need to identify
- start point 
-end point
-and condition

----kinds of loops
while loop
do-while loop
for loop

----types of loops
entry control loop 
checks the condition first if true allows otherwise not allowed
eg: while and for eg:movie ticket because without checking/validating we do not enter
exit control loop 
the test condition is checked after the execution of the body of the loop.
eg-do while



 If we need toString we can follow this step with out writting code
